          <h2 className='text-justify text-2xl font-bold'>Why Lucumillo?</h2>
          <p className='text-justify text-lg text-gray-300'>
            The name Lucumillo comes from Myrcianthes coquimbensis, a rare and endangered
            bush native to the coastal deserts of Chile. Its narrow distribution spans
            only a few hundred kilometers in the Coquimbo region, where it grows among
            large granite boulders, nourished by cool, moist breezes from the Pacific Ocean.
            The Lucumillo bush is deeply tied to this unique ecosystem,
            relying on specific environmental conditions and facing threats from
            habitat loss due to urban development and tourism.
          </p>
          <p className='text-justify text-lg text-gray-300'>
            We chose this name to honor the resilience of the Lucumillo, which,
            despite its fragility, thrives in the harsh conditions of the Chilean coastal desert.
            By adopting this name, we hope to raise awareness about the importance of
            conserving both the species and its delicate habitat. In doing so, we aim to contribute to
            the protection of this remarkable part of Chileâ€™s natural heritage.
